# Programming Languages 101

A famous functional programming language is ML (1973, evolved into SML and modern-day OCaml).
Our project of today is a tiny calculator language inspired by this family of languages.
The language has gotten the name ApoML, because it was Apostolis who kindly asked me to design
a training last minute and there was no time to think of something more clever.
